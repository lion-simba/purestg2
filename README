purestg2 - Stargazer authentication module for linux PPP daemon.

Project page: http://code.google.com/p/purestg2
Source code: https://github.com/lion-simba/purestg2

==== OVERVIEW ====
purestg2 comes as two plugins - one for Stargazer billing system
and one for PPP daemon (pppd).

The Stargazer part (mod_auth_purestg2.so) opens a UNIX domain
socket at specified address and listens for incoming connections
from pppd part.

When pppd configured for using purestg2 plugin (purestg2.so)
started, it connects to the specified UNIX domain socket and
do the following:

1. Ask Stargazer to lease a PPP unit number, which will be
assigned to the PPP interface (like ppp<number>).

NOTE:
Stargazer lease the first free PPP unit number starting from
specified minimum number. Unit number counted as free if it was 
NOT leased by Stargazer yet. Stargazer can't detect units spawned
by other processes.

2. After got the user's login, pass it to Stargazer and ask it
if the user is allowed to get access. If user allowed to get an
access, it's password is copied back to pppd and used to do
authentication of user. Both PAP and CHAP (including MS-CHAP-v2)
methods are supported.

3. If authentication was successfull:
3.1 Ask Stargazer for user's IP address and set it as remote
address of PPP connection.
3.2 Ask Stargazer to connect user.

4. Send a PING packet to Stargazer each N seconds (configurable,
60 by default) to check if Stargazer is still alive AND user is
still allowed to access. If Stargazer will not respond in N seconds,
pppd will die and connection will be terminated. If Stargazer
responds with "User is no more allowed to access" the pppd will die
and connection will be terminated.

NOTE:
Because of N seconds timeout, the actual connection termination
by the will of Stargazer will be done in time interval from 0 to
N seconds.

When user disconnects, pppd plugin ask Stargazer to disconnect
the user and then die.


==== INSTALLATION ====
See the INSTALL file and consider following:

Stargazer and pppd header files are required to compile. The
default location of pppd headers is /usr/include/pppd. You
can change this by passing --with-pppd-headers=<path> option
to configure script. The default location of Stargazer headers
is /usr/include/stargazer. You can change this by passing
--with-stg-headers=<path> option to configure script.

The Stargazer plugin must be placed in Stargazer's plugin (lib)
directory (/usr/lib/stg/ by default). You can change this by
passing --with-stg-libdir=<path> option to configure script.

The pppd plugin must be placed in pppd's plugin directory
(/usr/lib/pppd/<pppd version>/ by default). You can change this
by passing --with-pppd-libdir=<path> option to configure script.
Note that <pppd version> part will be appended automatically.


==== CONFIGURATION ====
Here is an example chunk of Stargazer configuration file for
using this plugin:
-----|<--------------------------------------
    <Module auth_purestg2>
        authsocket = /var/run/purestg2.sock
        minppp = 5
    </Module>
------------>|-------------------------------
authsocket is UNIX domain socket address.
minppp is the minimum PPP unit number for Stargazer PPP
clients.

Here is an example chunk of pppd options file for using 
this plugin:
-----|<--------------------------------------
    plugin purestg2.so
    authsocket /var/run/purestg2.sock
    keepalivetimeout 30
------------>|-------------------------------
authsocket is UNIX domain socket address.
keepalivetimeout is the time between two sequential PING
packets from pppd plugin to Stargazer (see above).
